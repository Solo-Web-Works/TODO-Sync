# TODO-Sync

TODO-Sync is a GitHub Action that automatically scans your codebase for TODO comments, creates or updates corresponding GitHub Issues, and generates a markdown summary file. This tool helps maintainers keep track of pending tasks directly from the source code, ensuring that nothing slips through the cracks.
